# the following events are examples for you to understand how to add custom events with this plugin.
# They all get registered and called.
# You can remove or add any event you want, but make sure that the labels (keys) are different.
# To let the plugin do something on these events, go to the section 'listener'.
# For more complex action on events, use the API.
# Please visit www.spigotmc.org/resources/35536/ for more information on the API.
events:
  # Event called every day, every 10 min
  exampleEvent1:
    timing:
      # 'every day' gets translated to 'monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday, saturday, sunday'
      occasion: "every day"
      time: "xx:00"
  exampleEvent2:
    timing:
      occasion: "every day"
      time: "xx:15,xx:30,xx:45,xx:00"
# General Calendar Events settings
settings:
  # If your server is in a different timezone then most of your players, you can add hours to the server time here.
  # Example:
  #     Server:   UTC +0
  #     Players:  UTC +1
  #     configure addHoursToServerTime = 1
  #     The events above will trigger at the configured times for your UTC +1 players!
  addHoursToServerTime: 0
  # The locale defines the month and day names in the event (%day%, %month%).
  # Use an IETF language tag (see: https://r12a.github.io/app-subtags/).
  language: "en"

# You can listen to calendar events in other plugins.
# But you can also use the listener in this plugin for basic actions.
# For example: send commands, messages, broadcasts, titles
# use & for colors
# %time% will be replaced with the events time (24h format hh:mm)
# %day% will be replaced with the name of the day in the locale defined at 'settings.locale'
# %month% will be replaced with the name of the month in the locale defined at 'settings.locale'
listener:
  exampleEvent1:
    # %allOnline%    --->  this gets called for every online player and will be replaced with the player name
    commands:
     - "minecraft:kill @e[type=enderman]"
     - "minecraft:kill @e[type=snowball]"
     - "minecraft:kill @e[type=bat]"
     - "minecraft:kill @e[type=arrow]"
     - "minecraft:kill @e[type=minecraft:zombie]"
     - "minecraft:kill @e[type=minecraft:zombified_piglin]"
     - "minecraft:kill @e[type=minecraft:zombie_villager]"
     - "save-all"
  exampleEvent2:
    commands:
     - "eco give %allOnline% 60000"
     - "minecraft:kill @e[type=minecraft:snowball]"
